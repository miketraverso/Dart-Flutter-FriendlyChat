# FriendlyChat

A Dart/Flutter project that introduces us to Dart with the Flutter & Firebase SDKs. This code accompanies the "Dart with Flutter: Your next new favorite language" slide deck that can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TwQgt3rMQ0bRnUrl77WRDFi4hWzBwWmqciUIwsnT0k4/edit?usp=sharing)

There's a `main.dart` file in the **lib** subdirectory. You can swap that code out with the numbered `main-x.dart` files to step through the different steps. In some cases I kept code commented out so that you can see what's changed between iterations.

Hope you enjoy!
